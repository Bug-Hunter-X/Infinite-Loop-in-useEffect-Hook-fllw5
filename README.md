This repository demonstrates a common error in React's `useEffect` hook: creating an infinite loop. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises from including the `count` state variable in the dependency array, leading to a continuous update cycle. The solution showcases how to properly manage state updates within the `useEffect` hook.
